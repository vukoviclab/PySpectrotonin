# PySpectrotonin
Overview
This repository contains a collection of Python scripts and Jupyter Notebooks designed for data preparation, analysis, visualization, and validation. Each file serves a specific purpose in the data processing and analysis workflow.

## Files and Usage

`data_preparation.py`
* Input: This script likely reads data, possibly from CSV files or similar data sources.
* Functionality: It's designed for data cleaning and preparation. The script might include functions for filtering, transforming, or normalizing data to make it suitable for analysis.

`running_reg.py`
* Input: The script reads data from CSV files, as indicated by the usage of pd.read_csv.
* Functionality: It performs regression analysis, potentially on sequence data. The script also uses a custom threshold module, suggesting that it might include threshold-based filtering or selection processes.

`scatter_plot.py`
* Input: The input details are not clear, but it likely involves numerical data suitable for scatter plotting.
* Functionality: The script is focused on generating scatter plots. It includes a custom scatter_plot function and adjusts plot aesthetics like font size, which suggests a focus on visual representation of data.

`threshold.py`
* Input: The exact inputs are not specified, but the script likely handles numerical or statistical data.
* Functionality: It deals with threshold analysis and processing. The script might include functions for identifying thresholds in data, preprocessing steps, and possibly statistical calculations.

`visualizing.py`
* Input: This script probably takes in various forms of data for visualization, such as numerical arrays or data frames.
* Functionality: It offers general data visualization tools, including the use of statistical tests and date-time operations, implying a broad scope of visualization techniques.

`barplots.ipynb`
* Input: The notebook reads data from a CSV file.
* Functionality: It focuses on creating bar plots. The notebook demonstrates data processing steps like reading data, dropping columns, and calculating averages before visualizing them in bar plots.

`running_visualization.ipynb`
* Input: Imports functions from other scripts like visualizing, data_preparation, and scatter_plot.
* Functionality: This notebook seems to integrate various visualization techniques, particularly in the context of regression analysis. It likely combines data preparation, scatter plotting, and other visualization methods.

`validation.ipynb`
* Input: Reads data from CSV files and uses glob operations to handle file paths.
* Functionality: The notebook is geared towards validating data. It includes concatenating data from multiple sources, calculating means, and integrating threshold analysis for validation purposes.
